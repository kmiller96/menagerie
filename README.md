# Menagerie

My collection of random prototypes and proof of concepts.

## Why?

I often build these random little mockups, tools, and proof of concepts and throw
them away. Silly! At one point of my life these things were interesting to me
and they should be held onto for (a.) reference (b.) nostalgia.

I originally considered that I should keep this repo private. However, I think
the world would benefit from having my prototypes out in the open. In particular,
it saves me the effort of having to send these prototypes to my friends and 
instead I can just point them here!

## What Should I Expect?

Absolutely nothing. You might find that prototypes that once worked are now 
broken. Git history might be rewritten without warning. I might even just make
this repo private one day.
