# Constraint Programming

Prototype showcasing how you can find feasible solutions to a very large set of
candidates. 

## Problem 
There is a 3x3 grid of spaces where a marble can be placed. You have 4 marbles.
Identify a solution where the fewest number of marbles are touching.

## Usage

```bash
# N = length of grid (e.g. N = 3 is a 3x3 grid)
# Y = number of marbles
python optimise.py <N> <Y>
```
