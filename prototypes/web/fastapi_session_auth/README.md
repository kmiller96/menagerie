# FastAPI Session Auth

Prototype showing how you can roll your own (simple) session-based authentication
using cookies

## Why?

I keep wanting to add authentication to my applications, but I really cbf 
learning a heavy plugin like `fastapi-users`. I'm sure after you learn the plugin
it's simple. However, for a first pass, it definitely seems like overkill.

I want to validate this assumption using a prototype of my own, as well as figure 
out how I can roll my own authentication if I decide to do so.
