# Inline TODO tasks

Allows you to specify TODO tasks inline in your codebase and have this script
extract those into a more structure data format.

## Why?

Gives you a centralised location to manage your upcoming work. In particular, 
technical work that is very tightly coupled to the implementation (e.g. 
refactoring).

## Quickstart

```bash
puzzles run example/  # Writes out the results to PUZZLES.md
```
