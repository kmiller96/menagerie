Welcome to my plain text file! I am mostly writing garbage; it's useful to just
write a whole lot of crap and see what the program spits out on the other side.

A bit of punctuation is good; it's also a great idea to do things like 
apostrophies where we can.

This file is (deliberately) not trying to say a lot. It's just a simple bit of
garbage.
